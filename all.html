    <h1>2018-2021 U.S. Firearm Mortality</h1>
    <div style="padding: 50px 100px 10px">
      <p id="message" style="font-size: 1em;"> 
        This country is suffering from perpetual gun violences, mass shootings, and gun suicides. 
        The nation's ongoing debate over gun controls versus gun ownership rights are ugly conflicts 
        that cost so many innocent lives every single day. While America should work hard to completely 
        abolish its pervasive gun culture deeply rooted in Colonialism, its strategies for reducing gun 
        deaths must be age, gender, race, and community specific.<br><br>
        This project is to visualize the U.S. firearm mortality between 2018 and 2021 to uncover causes 
        of gun deaths by age, race, and gender. It is also to visualize the association between 
        U.S. county poverty rates and firearm mortality, particularly gun homicides & suicides.

            Suicide (57.9%) and Assault (40.1%) were the foremost causes of gun-realted deaths. 
            170,974 people died from gun-related incidents between January, 2018 and December, 2021. 
            That's an average of 117 gun deaths per day. Click to view the chart.</p>

            The young adults, ages between 15 and 34, had the highest gun-related deaths. 
            They were 42.2% of all gun deaths between 2018 and 2021.

            While gun suicides and gun homicides were the two leading causes of gun-related deaths, 
            there was large disparities between the age groups in terms of the gun-suicide rates and gun-homicide rates.
            Gun homicides were the leading causes of gun deaths in younger age groups, 
            whereas suicides were the main causes of gun deaths in older age groups.
